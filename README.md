# PyxelRoadDemo

This demo uses road 3d projection method. It features hills, corners, scaling sprites, tracking player position, looping track, parallax background using python and pyxel library as a base to display stuff. You can read about the maths behind all of this here http://www.extentofthejam.com/pseudo/

## What it is?

Small road demo using (only) Pyxel library featuring 2.5D road like in Outrun/Road Rash/etc games with turns and bumps. Scalable sprites (loaded via arrays rather than spritesheet), parallax background with 2 levels (you can expand it), very basic controls and looped racing track.

## TO DO

1. Adjustable pallette in the race depending on the sprites shown 
2. Player sprite and improved player control
3. Player Y
4. AI/Bots also with scalable sprites
5. Lap count


## Requirements:
1. Python 3.10
2. Pyxel 1.9.18
